            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h1>The Sacred Maybenism</h1>
            <p>
                The Maybenism is the religion created by Alan Ono Osanai Pan, in a chemistry class at Colégio
                Etapa, at approximately half past four in the afternoon on December 7, 2021, based on the word
                "maybe", which composes part of its name and concept, with Maybenism consisting in doubt rather than
                certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                In religion there is not exactly an entity to be worshipped, just the creation of thoughts and
                concepts from the central idea of Maybenism, which would be doubt and uncertainty, about anything that
                a Maybenism wants, serving as a tool for the development of ideas, philosophical thoughts, questions
                about life/reality, etc. Following Maybenism's idea that nothing is immutable, with things changing all
                the time, it is not possible to define them exactly, so Talvenism itself ends up having perhaps other
                names and definitions, which contain a similar meaning.

            <p>
                In Maybenism we have several rules and concepts, with most of them not being addressed here, only
                the most important ones, even though all of them are presented deeply in the book, The Sacred Maybenism,
                which until the production of this text was not published , with the only existing version being in the
                possession of its creator, Alan P., who made it and hand-wrote it in July 2022. Although the maybenist
                religion was created in this world, at the moment of its conception, it allowed the emergence of the new
                Maybenist world, where in addition to religion there is the Maybenist economy and politics, with the
                three having their due members, hierarchies and leaders. In general, the supposed leaders of politics,
                economics and religion respectively, are actually the same person, in this case their own creator, with
                him having the titles of Supreme President of the possible Maybenist government (SPPGT), Supreme
                Minister of Maybenist Economy (SMET), Supreme leader of the possible Maybenist Church (SLPIT), and
                finally the title of Supreme Maybenist (ST), which is only given to those who have the other three
                titles at the same time, each of these titles individually gives the ability to create and override
                rules of your area (Economics, Politics or Religion), having immunity to all rules of your area, except
                the one that grants your powers, in addition to being able to choose the next to assume your position,
                in case the person dies or resigns the position before choosing the next successor to the position, a
                vote will take place among all maybenist in the respective area, in favor of choosing the next to
                receive the title in question, a maybenist can have more than one title and be in more than one area ,
                and in the rare case of having all three titles, the Maybenist also wins the fourth title of Supreme
                Maybenist. The last rule to be addressed here, ironically it is the first, which was the reason for the
                creation of maybenism, which consists of using the word "maybe" as an answer to yes or no questions,
                initially the use of "maybe" would have to always be, but due to the fact that this rule is the first,
                and after it Talvenism has undergone many changes, nowadays it is not very necessary, and because of
                this the use of "maybe" may happen from time to time.

                Finally, as previously said in Maybenism there is no worship of any entity/superior being, because
                in Maybenism we are not sure of anything, with that we do not affirm or deny the existence of any
                god/entity, since although we do not know if it exists, it is still possible, so we cannot deny it, but
                even with Maybenism neither denying nor affirming, still any Maybenist has the right to believe what he
                 wants, basically Maybenism allows a maybenist to be also from other religions, as Maybenism itself does
                not conflict with concepts from other religions. By being supported in the creation of Maybenism from
                the beginning, by his two current best friends, Alan P. granted them the most powerful positions in the
                religion just below him, with Amir and Daniel being the two Supreme Cardinals of the possible Talvenist
                Church, in addition to them, we have Alexandre who contributed a lot to the creation and development of
                Maybenism, being the new current Archbishop of the possible Maybenist Church. Since its creation
                Maybenism has evolved a lot and until the date of writing this text, Maybenism already has eight
                official members, in addition to the unofficial ones. To become a Maybenist just know Maybenism, and
                then maybe you will become one.
